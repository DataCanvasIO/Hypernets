# Search Space

For hyper-parameter optimization, the search space might be a closed subset of Euclidean space composed of discrete or continuous values. For neural architecture search(NAS), The network architecture is composed of graphs generated by various layers through connections, and all feasible graphs constitute the search space.

Hypernets introduced an abstract search space representation and taken into account both of the above requirements, so that it can use a unified primitive to define various search spaces.

## HyperSpace

The general form of `HyperSpace` is a graph formed by connecting nodes and edges, each node can contain a set of hyper-parameters. `HyperModel` can represent a pipeline, or a more complex directed acyclic graph(DAG), in some cases The objective function to be optimized has only one node, for example when we only need to optimize a few hyper-parameters of a lightgbm model.
 


## Parameter Space

ParameterSpace is diveded into two types: mutable and immutable. The mutable is created with a set of possible values, for example, `Real(0.1, 0.9)`, `Choice(['relu','tanh'])`, etc. The immutable includes `Constant`,`Dynamic`, and `Cascade`.

* Mutable: `Int`, `Real`, `Bool`, `Choice`, `MultipleChoice`

* Immutable: `Constant`, `Dynamic`, `Cascade`

## Connection Space

ConnectionSpace is used to represent possible connections between modules.

* Optional:  Whether to insert a module between two modules.
* Or:  There are several optional modules on a node, choose one of them.
* Sequential: A series of modules connected in order.
* InputChoice: A modules has n upstream modules, choose one or more connections.


## Module Space

ModuleSpace represents an optimizable function with a set of hyper-parameters. Unlike ParameterSpace and ConnectionSpace, ModuleSpace is related to frameworks or libraries. In different `HyperModel`, it is necessary to define a corresponding series of ModuleSpace.
