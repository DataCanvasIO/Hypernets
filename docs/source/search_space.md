# Search Space

For hyper-parameter optimization, the search space might be a closed subset of Euclidean space composed of discrete or continuous values. For neural architecture search(NAS), The network architecture is composed of graphs generated by various layers through connections, and all feasible graphs constitute the search space.

Hypernets introduced an abstract search space representation and taken into account both of the above requirements, so that it can use a unified primitive to define various search spaces.
