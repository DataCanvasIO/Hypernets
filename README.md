## We Are HiringÔºÅ
Dear folks, we are offering challenging opportunities located in Beijing for both professionals and students who are keen on AutoML/NAS. Come be a part of DataCanvas! Please send your CV to yangjian@zetyun.com. (Application deadline: TBD.)  

## Hypernets: A General Automated Machine Learning Framework
Hypernets is a general AutoML framework, based on which it can implement automatic optimization tools for various machine learning frameworks and libraries, including deep learning frameworks such as tensorflow, keras, pytorch, and machine learning libraries like sklearn, lightgbm, xgboost, etc.
We introduced an abstract search space representation, taking into account the requirements of hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search(NAS), making Hypernets a general framework that can adapt to various automated machine learning needs. As an abstraction computing layer, tabular toolbox, has successfully implemented in various tabular data types: pandas, dask, cudf, etc.

## Installation

### Conda

Install Hypernets with `conda` from the channel *conda-forge*:

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge hypernets
```

### Pip
Install Hypernets with different options:

* Typical installation:
```bash
pip install hypernets
```

* To run Hypernets in JupyterLab/Jupyter notebook, install with command:
```bash
pip install hypernets[notebook]
```

* To run Hypernets in distributed Dask cluster, install with command:
```bash
pip install hypernets[dask]
```

* To support dataset with simplified Chinese in feature generation, 
  * Install `jieba` package before running Hypernets.
  * OR install Hypernets with command:
```bash
pip install hypernets[zhcn]
```

* Install all above with one command:
```bash
pip install hypernets[all]
```


***Verify installation***:
```bash
python -m hypernets.examples.smoke_testing
```
