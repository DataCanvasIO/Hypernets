## We Are HiringÔºÅ
Dear folks, we are opening several precious positions based in Beijing both for professionals and interns avid in AutoML/NAS, please send your resume/cv to yangjian@zetyun.com. (Application deadline: TBD.)  

## Hypernets: A General Automated Machine Learning Framework
Hypernets is a general AutoML framework, based on which it can implement automatic optimization tools for various machine learning frameworks and libraries, including deep learning frameworks such as tensorflow, keras, pytorch, and machine learning libraries like sklearn, lightgbm, xgboost, etc.
We introduced an abstract search space representation, taking into account the requirements of hyperparameter optimization and neural architecture search(NAS), making Hypernets a general framework that can adapt to various automated machine learning needs.

## Installation

Install Hypernets with `pip` command:
 
```bash
pip install hypernets
```

Optional, to run Hypernets in JupyterLab notebooks, install Hypernets and JupyterLab with command:
```bash
pip install hypernets[notebook]
```

Optional, to run Hypernets in distributed Dask cluster, install Hypernets with command:
```bash
pip install hypernets[dask]
```

Optional, to support dataset with simplified Chinese in feature generation, install `jieba` package before run Hypernets, or install Hypernets with command:
```bash
pip install hypernets[zhcn]
```

Optional, install all Hypernets components and dependencies with one command:
```bash
pip install hypernets[all]
```


***Verify installation***:
```bash
python -m hypernets.examples.smoke_testing
```
